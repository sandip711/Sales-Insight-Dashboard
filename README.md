## Objective of the Project:
To create a sales dashboard using PowerBI for AtliQ hardware, providing the sales manager with a clear and visual representation of real data.
The objective is to enable data-driven decision-making by identifying the weakest areas that require focus for increasing sales and improving overall performance.
The dashboard should offer simple, understandable, and digestible insights accessible on a daily basis.
